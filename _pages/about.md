Greetings, curious minds! I'm Jason Ang, a passionate computer science enthusiast on a perpetual quest to explore the frontiers of technology and innovation. Currently navigating the academic landscape at the University of Florida, I wear multiple hats as a TA and a dedicated researcher. Beyond the binary realm, I find joy in the leisurely pursuit of golf and reading books. My appetite for knowledge and genuine curiosity about the world drive me to constantly seek new insights and perspectives. Join me on this journey of discovery as we unravel the mysteries that propel our ever-evolving world forward!


<!-- Jason Ang: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
